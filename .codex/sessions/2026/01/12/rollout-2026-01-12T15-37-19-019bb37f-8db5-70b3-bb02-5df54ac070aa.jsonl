Source in `dicom-mcp/src/dicom_mcp`, tests in `dicom-mcp/tests`, docs in `dicom-mcp/docs`, config template in `configs/dicom.yaml`, assets in `dicom-mcp/images`.\n- `dicom-nlquery/`: Natural-language query pipeline that delegates to `dicom-mcp`. Source in `dicom-nlquery/src/dicom_nlquery`, tests in `dicom-nlquery/tests`, scripts in `dicom-nlquery/scripts`, configs in `dicom-nlquery/config.yaml` and `dicom-nlquery/config-test.yaml`, lexicons in `dicom-nlquery/configs/`.\n- `pacs-rag/`: Optional PACS term index + retrieval to power RAG rewrites. Source in `pacs-rag/pacs_rag`, tests in `pacs-rag/tests`.\n- `configs/`: Shared DICOM + LLM configuration (`dicom.yaml`, `llm.yaml`, `llm-test.yaml`); use `model: \"default\"` for server-selected LLMs.\nDesign notes live in `plan.md`.\n\n## Build, Test, and Development Commands\n\nUse Python 3.12+ and `uv`. Recommended shared venv:\n```bash\ncd dicom-nlquery\nuv venv && source .venv/bin/activate\nuv pip install -e \".[dev]\"\nuv pip install -e ../dicom-mcp\nuv pip install -e ../pacs-rag\n```\nRun the MCP server:\n```bash\ncd dicom-mcp\nuv run --with-editable '.' -m dicom_mcp ../configs/dicom.yaml\n```\nRun NL query CLI:\n```bash\ndicom-nlquery dry-run \"cranial exams\"\ndicom-nlquery execute --date-range 20240101-20241231 \"exams from 2024\"\n```\nTests require Orthanc:\n- `dicom-mcp`: `cd dicom-mcp/tests && docker-compose up -d`, then `pytest`.\n- `dicom-nlquery`: `docker compose -f dicom-nlquery/tests/docker-compose.yml up -d`, then `pytest tests/unit/ -v` or `pytest tests/integration/ -v -m integration`.\n`pacs-rag` tests are local-only: `cd pacs-rag && pytest -v`.\n\n## Coding Style & Naming Conventions\n\nFollow PEP 8 with 4-space indentation, type hints for public APIs, and docstrings for public modules/classes/functions. Prefer descriptive, DICOM-aligned naming (e.g., `query_studies`, `move_series`). No repo-wide formatter is configured, so keep style consistent with existing files.\n\n## Language Policy\n\nThe project language is English. Documentation, code comments, CLI interface text, and test queries must be in English. Do not use Portuguese.\n\n## Golden Rule\n\nDo not hardcode solutions for specific cases. Do not hardcode body part names, specific exam names, or specific DICOM node names in application logic. Exception: tests may use hardcoded queries, but they must include multiple varied queries to avoid specializing on a single case.\n\n## Testing Guidelines\n\nTests use `pytest`. Name tests `test_*.py` and place them under the matching package’s `tests/` tree. Integration tests assume Orthanc on ports 4242/8042; restart containers if you change configuration files.\n\n## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines\n\nCommit history uses short, present-tense verbs like “Add”, “Update”, “Remove”, “Refactor”. Keep subjects concise (about one line) and reference issues when applicable. PRs should include: what changed, why, how, and how it was tested. Update docs in `dicom-mcp/docs` or READMEs when behavior or usage changes.\n\n## Security & Configuration Tips\n\nDo not commit real PHI or PACS credentials. Use synthetic test data (see `dicom-mcp/tests`) and keep sensitive values in local YAML config files. `pacs-rag` ingestion skips likely PHI strings (names/long numeric tokens).\n\n## Agent Protocol Notes (dicom-nlquery)\n\nWhen adjusting the agent pipeline, preserve the tool-call protocol: one tool call per step, no inferred clinical filters, and explicit `destination_node` for `move_study`.\n\n\n## Skills\nA skill is a set of local instructions to follow that is stored in a `SKILL.md` file. Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /home/user/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /home/user/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","source":"cli","model_provider":"openai","git":{"commit_hash":"c2e1fdbae77b057c219de5b5d22d40e1ffad54aa","branch":"001-dicom-nlquery","repository_url":"https://github.com/ThalesMMS/Natural-Language-DICOM-Query.git"}}}
